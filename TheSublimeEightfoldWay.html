        THE SUBLIME EIGHTFOLD WAY

       This practice of meditation is based on the teaching of the Buddha called the “Sublime-Eight-fold Way” (
       <i>
        ariya atthangika magga
       </i>
       ), which is the way to the cessation of all suffering. The term “ariya,” which is commonly translated as “noble,” we have translated as “Sublime,” because it is a supernormal state. This is because the Buddha used the term “ariya” to refer to a higher level of consciousness beyond the normal. The aim of Buddhist meditation is to raise the human consciousness to a higher level, which is beyond the normal. It is more meaningful to translate it as “super-normal,” rather than “noble.” Just as the aim of modern psychotherapy is to raise an abnormal person to a normal level of living, the aim of the Buddha was to bring the normal person to a super-normal level.

       We call this supernormal level “Sublime.” It is very important therefore to understand this distinction between “noble” and “Sublime.” This is why we call Buddhist meditation a growth technique, rather than the practice of rules or the rituals in obedience to a lord, out of fear or favour. Therefore, the purpose of the practice of Buddhist meditation is to grow to a higher level of emotional maturity, beyond the normal, and to experience a degree of happiness and kindness beyond the normal. Buddhist meditation is a method of gaining emotional maturity through purification of the mind.

       This process of growth of the mind takes place as a psychological evolutionary process. Although biological evolution went on unconsciously based on the natural law of “determinism,” this psychological evolutionary process is consciously executed following a systematic technique, because it is the evolution of consciousness itself. It does not work unconsciously or automatically, or even through a supernatural

       power. It too is based on the natural law of determinism, though consciously achieved.

       This practice is based on one’s own human power. We are not depending on any external power, not even that of a teacher or
       <i>
        guru
       </i>
       . We have to do it self-reliantly by ourselves. This is a “do-it-yourself” technique. We do not believe that a person is born with a free will, but will-power has to be developed, based on the principle of determinism. In a sense, this method of meditation can be called the development of will power, to control one’s irrational emotions. In other words, we are using our conscious mental power to control the unconscious mental process that is going on deterministically.

       This is what one learns from our lessons at the center and during our retreats. It is learning how to act rationally instead of emotionally. One will be shown the tools within one, to work on oneself. Working on oneself is ones own job, not the teacher’s. The teacher’s job is only to show the tools that one already possesses, and to give the instructions on how to use them. Our hope is that you will be able to work on yourself and grow, evolve, and transform. The degree of transformation, and quality of life experienced is the measure of progress. What we look for is growth and transformation, not mere insight. This is why we do not call this method of meditation, “insight meditation.” We also do not expect visions or hallucinations of any kind. If what you gain from a retreat is only more will- power, and peace of mind, then you have gained a degree of success.

       The first thing one must do is to acquire the right understanding that comes in the form of the harmonious perspective. One must understand that all unhappiness that we experience in life is not due to our unfavorable circumstances,
      </span>
      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       but due to the way we react to our circumstances or our attitude to circumstances. This means that our unhappiness, its cause, and its cure and the way to its cure are within us. In other words, we must stop worrying about our circumstances, and start questioning our attitude to our circumstances, in order to correct it.
