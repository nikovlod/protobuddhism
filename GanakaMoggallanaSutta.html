       2. “Master Gotama, in this mansion of Migara’s Mother there can be seen a gradual path, a gradual stepping, and a gradual progress, down to the last step of the staircase. Among these Brahmins too there can be seen a gradual path, gradual practice, and gradual progress, in our studies. Among archers too there can be seen a similar gradual training. Also among accountants like us, who earn our living by accountancy, there is to be seen a gradual training in computation. When we get an apprentice, we first teach him how to count. Is it also possible, master Gotama, to describe a gradual path of training in this Dhamma and Discipline?”

Show me the road to Rajagaha.’ Then you told him: ‘Good man, this is the road that goes to Rajagaha. Follow it for awhile and you will see a certain village, go a little further and you will see a certain town, go a little further and you will see Rajagaha with its lovely

      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       parks, groves, meadows, and ponds.’ Then, having been thus advised and instructed by you, he would take a wrong road and would go to the west. Then suppose a second man came, who wanted to go to Rajagaha, and he approached you and said: ‘Dear sir, I want to go to Rajagaha. Show me the road to Rajagaha.’ Then you told him the way similarly. Then, having been thus advised and instructed by you, he would arrive safely in Rajagaha. Now, Brahmin, since Rajagaha exists and the path leading to Rajagaha exists and you are present as the guide, what is the cause and reason why, when those men have been advised and instructed by you, one man takes a wrong road and goes to the west, and one arrives safely in Rajagaha?’’
