      The original teachings of the Buddha are found in the earliest recordings, carried by rote

      in the form of the Pali

      school of Buddhism
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      seems to have preserved at least some of the original teachings, even though this school
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      may not have paid adequate attention to them. This school laid more emphasis on the

     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      texts called the Abhidhamma, which was only an interpretation of the teachings
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      according to a particular school, rather than the original teachings of the Buddha.

      we shall discuss at first
      <b>
       the basic psychological problem
      </b>
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      experienced by all human beings, as seen by Sigmund Freud, the father of modern
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      psychotherapy. We shall then compare this with the description of the

     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      <b>
       problem of human existence
      </b>
      given by the Buddha. We shall also discuss the problem of
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      existence as seen by Charles Darwin, when he formulated the theory of evolution. We
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      shall see how these three descriptions wonderfully complement one another. Then we
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      shall examine how Freud attempted to solve this problem, and how he lamented about the
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      imperfections of his method. This will be followed by a description of the method used
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      by the Buddha and the reason for its success in transforming individuals. We shall also
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      dwell on the method adapted by the Buddha to go beyond the goal of Freud. Freud’s
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      main concern was to help his patients, suffering from abnormal conditions of health, to
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      return to normal. The Buddha on the other hand, was interested in helping normal people
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      to overcome their normal worries and anxieties, including the fear of death; and in doing
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      so, he discovered a supernormal state of perfect mental health and happiness, through a
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      process of evolution of the human consciousness. We shall also discuss this process of
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      human evolution in relation to Darwin’s biological theory of evolution, and refer the
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      culmination of this evolutionary process in the evolution of the human consciousness to
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      the point where the evolutionary process stops. This concern of the Buddha in
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      transforming the normal to a “supernormal mental health” may be judged from modern
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      standards as too farfetched. Yet an examination of the Buddha’s methods and his findings
     </span>
     <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
      may open the eyes of those who are puzzled by the psychotherapeutic problems of the
