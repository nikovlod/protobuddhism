      All that is near and dear to me is subject to change and separation. When these things are changing and separating all that is left is my emotional state (
      <i>

      ). My emotional state makes me unhappy. By depending on changing external conditions for happiness I experience sorrow and unhappiness. While not depending on these external conditions for my happiness, I cultivate dispassion, compassion, happiness and tranquillity, I gain true happiness. Pleasure is stimulation of the senses. Happiness is a state of mind free from selfish emotions.
