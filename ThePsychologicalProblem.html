        The Psychological Problem

       The problem here then is psychological rather than philosophical or scientiﬁc. The problem is the anxiety that all beings experience in the face of death. All living things including plants are struggling to exist. Yet the struggle is a failure because death supervenes. The individual always dies. What continues is only the race or species in the form of progeny. When we come to conscious beings, especially the human being, we ﬁnd that the problem is not merely a physical one but it is also psychological. Fortunately, however, it is also the human being who ultimately ﬁnds the solution to the problem, by developing one’s consciousness. This means, becoming conscious of the problem, its cause, its end, and the way to its end.

       The intelligent human being can realize that we are biological organisms that make a mistake in struggling to exist, although it is not consciously done by plants or animals other than the human being. It is the human being that can understand that we are seeking permanence in an impermanent world, and that this effort is futile, frustrating, painful and unrealistic. It is only by stopping the struggle to exist as an individual that peace could be attained. In other words, what we should seek is not immortality but freedom from the unrealistic desire for immortality, which clashes with the reality of impermanence and death. This way, one can accept death, not with a grin but with a smile of understanding, and peaceful tranquillity.

      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       notions and aspirations, which were producing the anxiety or suffering. If God is reality, then the acceptance of the reality of death and impermanence is the acceptance of God. It is the emotional feeling of “self” that comes in conﬂict with reality and creates the suffering or insecurity of life. Here we might recall the Gospel saying, "One who loses his “self” for my sake shall ﬁnd it." Science, then, is not seen as our foe but as our friend. It is this original form of Buddhism, or Proto Buddhism, alone that can, not only reconcile science with religion, but also see the unity in the diversity of religion.
