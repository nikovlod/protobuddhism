        Buddha on the structural hypothesis

       One might ask at this point whether the Buddha ever spoke about anything like the structural hypothesis of Freud. In fact he did in different words. He used an analogy saying that there are three kinds of people in the world.

       One is blind in both eyes, the second is blind only in one eye, and the third has vision in both eyes. What are these eyes? The first eye is the eye that sees how to satisfy one’s desires. The second is the eye that sees what is good and bad. If we compare this statement with the structural hypothesis, it is clear that the person with both eyes blind is the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       . And the person with the one eye open is the one whose
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       has developed, because the first eye that sees how to satisfy desires is the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       . The second eye that sees what is good and bad is obviously the
       <i>
        super ego
       </i>
       . The second eye is also called by the Buddha
       <i>
        hiri-ottappa
       </i>
       , which means “abhorrence and
      </span>
      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       remorse” (sometimes translated as “shame and fear”), which is the “reluctance to do evil and repentance for having done evil.” The activity of the
       <i>
        super ego
       </i>
       censuring the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       is referred to as, “the self reproaching the self” (
       <i>
        attanam atta upavadati
       </i>
       ).

       What Freud saw, as the problem, was that the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       comes in conflict with the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       and the
       <i>
        super ego
       </i>
       . The
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       is unaware of the external reality and it demands immediate satisfaction. The
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       is aware only of what it wants; it is not concerned about how it is obtained. The
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       on the other hand is aware of the external reality, and only the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       knows how to gratify the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       . The
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       wants to gratify the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       , but it can be gratified only within the confines of reality. Immediate gratification is not always possible. Therefore, the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       might have to postpone gratification. This, the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       does not like. The
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       is uncomfortable till it is gratified.

       This conflict, between the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       and the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       , sounds very much like the familiar conflict between the child and the mother. The child cries for food but only the mother
      </span>
      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       knows how to get it. But then, the mother has to prepare it before the child can have it. This takes time. Therefore, the satisfaction has to be postponed. But the child wants food immediately, and is unconcerned about how it can be got. The child remains hungry and cries till the food is given. The child, according to Freud, is mainly the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       , and is dominated by the pleasure principle. The emotionally mature adult, on the other hand, whose
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       is strong, is dominated by the reality principle. Even in the emotionally immature adult, the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       is in control, even though it is weak.

       If the child makes demands that are detrimental to itself as well as to others, and the mother is undecided, in such a case the father may intervene and demand that the mother must not cater to the child’s irresponsible demands. If the mother follows the father’s advice, the child will not be satisfied at all, and it will continue to cry. So the mother has to find a way of satisfying the child while at the same time following the father’s advice.
      </span>
      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       This is an analogy where the father represents the
       <i>
        super ego
       </i>
       , the mother represents the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       , and the child represents the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       . The super
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       does not deal with the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       directly, but only through the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       . The
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       is always in control even when it is weak. The
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       has to find ways of satisfying the id as well as the super
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       . The
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       becomes the mediator between the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       , the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       , and also the external reality.
