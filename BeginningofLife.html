       From a modern scientific point of view, what we call
       <b>
        life
       </b>
       is only an
       <b>
        unconscious electro-chemical activity
       </b>
       that begins due to the presence of the necessary conditions, and ends due to the absence of the necessary conditions. Each necessary condition is also dependent on other necessary conditions without an ultimate beginning.

       This dynamic process of electrochemical activity follows the
       <b>
        natural law of determinism
       </b>
       , which means that every activity is determined by the presence of the necessary conditions. Life began when a special kind of molecule came into being due to presence of the necessary conditions. This molecule had a special ability to absorb atoms from the surroundings and produce molecules of its own kind. This
       <b>
        self-replicating molecule
       </b>
       was not the product of a Supernatural Creator either God or Devil. It came into being only due to the presence of the necessary conditions.

     <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       This means, that the electrochemical process called
       <b>
        life
       </b>
       began automatically, based on the natural law of determinism. New molecules thus formed, however, began to break down when some necessary conditions were absent. Therefore two processes continued at the same time: a building up process (anabolism) and a breaking down process (catabolism), collectively known as “metabolism.” When the building up process was faster than the breaking down process, the net result was growth. When the breaking down process was faster than the building up process, the net result was decay, leading ultimately to death. The continuity of these two processes
      </span>
      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       of growth and decay, is what we call
       <b>
        life
       </b>
       . It was this process of growth and decay that appeared to Charles Darwin as an unconscious
       <b>
        struggle for existence
       </b>
       .

       As conditions in the environment changed, however, the environment itself likewise changed, and was no longer favourable for this struggle to continue. Though most molecules were destroyed, a few molecules somehow were able to survive at least for some time, despite the hardships. This survival became possible only through an adaptation to the changing environment, in some way. This was what made Darwin speak of the
       <b>
        survival of the fittest
       </b>
       , though it was only a temporary survival, because every integration was subject to disintegration when even one necessary condition was absent. All these facts however boil down to one single fact that this unconscious struggle was a
       <b>
        mission impossible
       </b>
       . It was a struggle to exist where
       <b>
        existence was not possible
       </b>
       , because life is only a
       <b>
        dynamic process of activity
       </b>
       , rather than a
       <b>
        static “existence.” Existence
       </b>
       is a
       <b>
        static concept
       </b>
       in a
       <b>
        dynamic reality

       Among the early scientific theories of how the first self- replicating molecule came into existence was the "primordial soup," where simple molecules mixed together in a broth that was regularly energised by ultraviolet light and electric storms. Scientists have long believed RNA molecules were more likely to be the origin of life than DNA. Now they think there must have been a simpler molecule that spawned RNA.

       This

       called

        life
       </b>
       , though it started with one self-replicating molecule, began to produce several molecules of the same kind, and each new molecule began to create a series of other molecules, and many such series or chains of molecules came into being. Then these molecules began to combine to form cells, and cells combined to form tissues, tissues combined to form organs, organs
      </span>
      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       combined to form systems, and systems combined to form organisms. That was how the molecules evolved to produce organisms such as plants and animals. It was this unconscious electro-chemical activity that developed into what is today called the
       <b>
        biochemical
       </b>
       process of
       <b>
        evolution
       </b>
       . Charles Darwin saw this unconscious biological activity as a struggle for existence. This struggle though unconscious, and not wilfully done, was a
       <b>
        mission impossible
       </b>
       . It was a
       <b>
        futile struggle
       </b>
       because
       <b>
        real existence
       </b>
       was not a
       <b>
        possibility
       </b>
       . Existence was
       <b>
        a static concept
       </b>
       in a
       <b>
        dynamic reality
       </b>
       . In other words, existence is
       <b>
        a conceptual
       </b>
       fallacy or a
       <b>
        delusion
