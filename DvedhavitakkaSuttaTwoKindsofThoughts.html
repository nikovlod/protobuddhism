       Then the Blessed One said: “Before my awakening, Bhikkhus, while I was still an unawake Bodhisatta, it occurred to me: “Suppose I distinguish between good thoughts and bad thoughts”. So I separated passionate, angry, and violent thoughts; from dispassionate, kind, and peaceful thoughts”.

       When I dwelt thus watchful, alert, and vigilant, a passionate thought arose in me. Then I recognized: “A passionate thought has arisen in me, this can lead to my own harm, to others harm and to the harm of both. It obstructs intelligence, favours destructiveness, and leads me away from Nibbana. When I considered: “this lead to my own harm”, it subsided in me. When I considered, this leads to others harm, it subsided in me. When I considered, this leads to the harm of both, it subsided in me. When I considered, this obstructs intelligence, favours destructiveness, and leads me away from Nibbana, it subsided in me.
