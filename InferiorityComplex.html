        Inferiority complex

       Alfred Adler, one of the pioneers of modern psychotherapy, pointed out that the inferiority feeling is at the root of all psychological problems. This inferiority feeling develops in early childhood because children are naturally weaker than adults. In addition, the growing child is bound to meet children who are better than him in certain ways. Therefore, no one escapes feelings of inferiority and envy. All children want to be in the limelight, be the centre of attention, and be accepted. Inferiority means that one is not accepted, one is not in the limelight. Inferiority feelings cause children to feel that they are not fit to be in the limelight, and that, if they were thrown into the limelight, people would discover their inferiority or unfitness and reject them. Of course, they are only rejecting themselves by judging themselves in this way. Yet, not realising this, they shy away from public attention. They begin to shiver when attention is focused on them. This inferiority feeling, when carried into adult life, prevents people from getting ahead in life. This could also lead to any or all of the many varieties of psychological problems mentioned above. Thus no one escapes from psychological problems, it is normal to have them - it is supernormal to be free of them.

       People compensate for these inferiority feelings in various ways. One might compensate by trying to achieve greatness in some way or other, good or bad, social or antisocial. One might become a philanthropist, a criminal or a neurotic according to how one compensates. This is also how character is developed, whether good or bad.

      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       Withdrawal into neurosis or functional psychosis is an attempt to compensate in an unrealistic way. This unrealistic compensation can also lead to perversions, alcoholism, drug addiction, and even suicide. This is also what makes people turn to crime and war. Good as well as bad can come out of inferiority feelings, depending on how one chooses to deal with them. And no one can escape inferiority feelings.
