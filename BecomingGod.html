       To become God, however, is also to become fully human, by eliminating the animal nature within, which is the “self-centered emotions.” The difference between the human

       being and the other animals is mainly in the brain. The human being is at a higher evolutionary level, because of his ability to think and reason out logically. The modern scientific discoveries and technology, which have brought so much comfort and conveniences to mankind is the result of this ability to think. Yet this special ability of the human being is mainly used to gratify human cravings and for destructive purposes like wars and crime.

       The human being today is not fully evolved, and he is not fully conscious of the damage he is doing to himself and others, and the world at large. He is obstructing the very

       he is craving for. It is like a baby with unsafe toys or a child with dangerous weapons. The human being is still like the animal that is carried away by emotions. Emotions are dominating his mind. His reason is only used as a slave of the emotions to gratify the emotions.

       This is what Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, saw in the child and the neurotic; they are both dominated by the pleasure principle (the
       <i>
        id
       </i>
       ). The difference between neurosis and normality is only a matter of degree. “All normal people (
       <i>
        puthujjana
       </i>
       ),” said the Buddha, “are insane.” This means they are either psychotic or neurotic to some degree. They are mainly following two extreme ways of living, according to the Buddha. They are devoted to sensual pleasure or practicing an ascetic way of life, suppressing the emotions, both being mentally sick. According to Sigmund Freud the healthy personality is dominated by the reality principle (the
       <i>
        ego
       </i>
       ). The Buddha too pointed out that the healthy way of living is the medial path between emotional indulgence and self-mortification, which is the pursuit of the imperturbable serenity of mind and body.

       This means, the healthy way of living for the human being is to maintain a tranquil mind and be dominated by reason and
      </span>
      <span style='font-family: "georgia" , "times new roman" , serif; font-size: large;'>
       not by emotion. All emotions are self-centered according to the Buddha, and so was it for Freud. Unselfish good behaviour is possible only when the mind is free of selfish emotions. Universal goodwill (
       <i>
        mettā
       </i>
       ) is not an emotion. It comes from a mind free of the self-centered emotions. Emotion is a disturbance of the mind and body. It is a tranquil mind and a relaxed body that is free of self-centered emotions. It is such a mind that can become interested in the welfare of others for their sake. This selfless interest in the welfare of all beings (
       <i>
        mettā
       </i>
       ) is genuine love. This means true love and mental health is the absence of self-centered emotions.

       The rational faculty or the intellect is the special quality that distinguishes the human being from other animals. The development of this faculty and the mind being dominated by reason instead of emotion is the way to become fully human. Therefore gaining freedom from emotional domination and being dominated by reason is not only conducive to mental health, but it is also the way to become fully human. This also means, to realize the religious ideal of union with God is to become fully human. To become fully human is to transcend all human weaknesses and become superhuman. This fully human state is therefore supernormal or superhuman. It is divine because it is the realization of the ideal of perfection that human beings worship as God.

       This is why Buddhism is a humanistic religion, which is a process of evolution of the human consciousness to the ultimate point in the evolutionary process. The human being transcends the ordinary imperfect human state and becomes fully human in reaching the state of perfection. In doing so the human being enters a Superhuman Divine state. This fully human state is no more human because it has transcended all human weaknesses and become united with God and become God.
